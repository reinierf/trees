Nice-to-have improvements to pick up later.

## UI / Components

- **PanelHeader component** — `SpeciesListPanel` and `FavouritesPanel` share an identical header shell (`flex items-center justify-between px-4 py-3` wrapper + `flex items-center gap-2` right-side button group). Extract into a shared `PanelHeader` component in `InfoPopup.tsx` or a new file. `TreeDetailPanel` differs enough (different padding, button title, second row) to leave untouched.
